# What I've Done Since Our Last Meeting

## [Exercism](./markdown/)

I took on the interesting problem of the Exercism Markdown challenge. This challenge gives you a fairly tangled program that can parse certain Markdown tokens into their corresponding HTML elements. The program they provide is difficult to understand and has some other mind-bending characteristics and (not surprisingly) would probably prove hard to maintain. I changed this into a parsing object that gets (almost?) all of its directives from a rules dictionary. Hopefully it's better than what I started with. A copy of my submitted solution, along with the test cases provided by Exercism, is stored [here](./markdown/).

## [GitHub API](./github-api/)

Andrew showed great initiative digging into the Google Sheets API, and that made me think that it might be good to put together a more typical API use case just so we'd have one of those in our toolbox. I chose to use the GitHub API since we're already using GitHub. It's always good to see data that means something when you're learning a new concept. Go ahead and [take a look](./github-api/) at the little test program I ~~wrote~~ [pretty much stole from here](https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/using-github-api-in-python).
