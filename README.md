# Python meetings with Andrew

## 2020-03-01: first meeting

This was our initial meeting. We went through a few quick examples that touched on the following:

- using print() to display text
- using `def` to define a function
- why debuggers are useful! a little bit
- using indentation to define text blocks (scope)
  - if statements
  - for loops
- the difference between printing numbers and printing strings
  - `print(3 + 2)` vs `print('3 + 2')`
- how to decide if to print "diamond" or "diamonds"
- how to test whether our diamond code is working properly
- how to generate random amounts of diamonds and decide whether it's a lot or not

Andrew brought a program that he wrote that rolled dice for the user. It asked two questions:

- how many sides should be on each die?
- how many rolls should there be?

The program would simulate the rolls, display them, and add up the total. If the total of the rolls was under a certain threshhold, the program would indicate this when presenting the total.

We used the time to go over this program. Andrew had independently solved a lot of problems in ingenious ways, using Python features we had not discussed yet. We looked at some different ways to approach some of those problems.
