# Python meetings with Andrew

## First meeting, 2020-03-01

This was our initial meeting. We went through a few quick examples that touched on the following:

- using print() to display text
- using `def` to define a function
- why debuggers are useful! a little bit
- using indentation to define text blocks (scope)
  - if statements
  - for loops
- the difference between printing numbers and printing strings
  - `print(3 + 2)` vs `print('3 + 2')`
- how to decide if to print "diamond" or "diamonds"
- how to test whether our diamond code is working properly
- how to generate random amounts of diamonds and decide whether it's a lot or not
